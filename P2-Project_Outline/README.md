## Submission Instructions

### Overview 
The project is called Recipe Quest. It will allow anyone to search, by a category, i.e., Beef, Chicken, Dessert, for recipes on a public API. The user must register/sign-in in order to view, add or delete a recipe to or from their "favorites" located in a MySql database.

As the person responsible for "What's for dinner?", I get tired of cooking and eating the same things all the time.
While there are probably hundreds of recipe websites out there containing thousands of recipes, it can sometimes take hours trying to pick one.  This public API contains unique recipes from around the world. This is the place to find something different.
### Features
a) Call an API to display a list of categories that can be selected for the recipe search.
b) Call an API by the selected category to gather all recipes for that category.
c) Display all the recipes for the selected category by picture and recipe name. A recipe is selected by clicking on the picture.
d) The entire recipe is displayed for a selected recipe and the user can decide to save it to their "favorites".
e) Require the user to register/sign-in in order to access their "favorites" to view, add, or delete recipes. 

### Technologies
a) ASP.NET MVC
b) C#
c) Bootstrap
d) MySql
### What I'll Have to Learn
a) How to use Bootstrap to format my pages.
b) Deserialize the API's that contain a root.
