### Project Repository
[Recipe Quest Project Repo](https://github.com/RoseWilson812/RecipeQuest)

The initial commit includes a basic "Welcome" ASP.NET Core Web Application.

The home page commit is the first page of the app. It determines whether it searchs the API or the MySQL database for recipes based on user selection.

The search-all-page commit displays a page containing 2 search lists that can be used to search the API for recipes. A list of categories and a list of origins.

The display-meal-by-category commit will display a page showing all recipes for a given category search.

The display-meal-by-origin commit will display a page showing all recipes for a given origin search.
